            Overview
          </h2>
          <p>I am a dedicated software engineer, having more than a decade of experience in software design and development. Creating software is my passion and my hobby. My biggest expertise is in C++, as well as Java/Python as secondary languages, separately or together. I supported legacy systems, implemented new systems, and designed them from scratch. I have experience both in enterprise and in startups, setting up development processes and workflows, Agile/Scrum, code review, Continuous Integration, and task tracking, and providing technical leadership to a small team of Software Engineers, DevOps and QA. You can take a look at my projects on Github, including but not limited to software projects:</p>

              From this point, I turned from large corporations to small startups. With my enterprise experience, I defined basically everything from architecture to process from scratch, including Continuous Integration and QA, but still, it was still mostly technical, not a management position.

            <p>
              Probably, the most technically challenging project in my corporate career so far. It was a low-latency trading platform, and I improved latency-critical (<20 mcs for the trading cycle) messaging system performance. At last, I used lock-free algorithms not as a programming brain-teaser, but in production code.

              A significant risk-management system with multi-tier architecture, where I touched modules doing analytics, computation, and distributed computing, but the scale of the system was 100 times more than I knew. Here I worked closely with the analytics team, converting business requirements to software architecture and program code, and providing occasional support to business users. During this time I significantly improved the continuous integration pipeline based on the TeamCity server and Python automation.

              My primary project was Numerix CrossAsset, a flexible platform for structuring, pricing, and risk managing derivatives, accessible through Excel add-ins, C++, C#, or Java API. I did lots of QA automation of all sorts, introducing writing black-box tests in Python for my team, since numbers are very testable, naturally including performance profiling in the test coverage.
