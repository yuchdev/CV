### Overview

Dedicated software engineer, having more than a decade of experience in software design and development. My job is my passion and hobby. My biggest expertise is C++/Python, separately or together, with these technologies and my interest to create high-quality software, I can create almost everything.

I supported legacy systems, implemented new systems, and designed them from scratch.

I have experience both in enterprise and in startups.

I was setting up development processes and workflows, Agile/Scrum, code review, Continuous Integration, and task tracking, managed a team of Software Engineers, DevOps, and QAs.

You can take a look at examples of my code on Github, so that get some view of the coding standards I'm keeping during my daily work, and insist to be implemented within my team:

[Probabilistic calculator, checking whether the file encrypted or not](https://github.com/yuchdev/entropy_calculator)

[Simple multi-threaded password bruteforcer for MD5 hash (with educational purpose only!)](https://github.com/yuchdev/md5bruteforcer)

[Generator of program code](https://github.com/yuchdev/code_generator)

### Employment history

#### 09.2018 – current time
[Vanguard Software Solutions – IT Security startup](https://www.multiacc.tools/)

Position: Lead C++ developer

In this startup I was working on a line of products:

* IP Audit. Anti-fraud system for a comprehensive audit of IP addresses, providing reports about geographical location, connection details, and threats that could possess that IP address. I’m working on the server-side, developing an Anti-Fraud API Aggregator, collecting information from a number of 3rd-party APIs.
* Virtualbox. Powerful opensource x86/AMD64/Intel64 virtualization product. I created my own branch with slight improvements over the Oracle version, implemented a cross-platform build toolchain, and worked on documentation.

Programming languages, products and technologies: C, C++, Qt5, Python, PyQt, Django REST Framework, CMake, TeamCity

#### 09.2019 – 12.2019
[Massive– Distributed computing service provider](https://www.joinmassive.com/)

Position: Senior Software Engineer

Working on cross-platform Windows/macOS SDK for alternate application monetization platform, giving developer much more freedom of earning on his free applications, than just adding annoying ads.

Here I fix bugs and make improvements in both product and development practices. Applying the best of my experience to deliver the product and make the routine development process both efficient and comfortable.

Programming languages, products and technologies: C++, Python, JavaScript, CMake, AWS API, Google Test

#### 10.2014 – 07.2018
[WebGear Services (Trademark CyberYozh)– internet privacy startup](https://cyberyozh.com/)

Position: Consultant, Lead C++ developer

From this point, I turned from large corporations to small startups. With my enterprise experience I defined basically everything from architecture to process "from the scratch", including Continuous Integration, QA, but it still was still mostly technical, not a management position.

Projects: I’ve been working on a line of cross-platform products for the end-user privacy and security – VPN client with traffic leakage protection and PanicButton, Emergence Data Erasure System, which destroy all sensitive data in case of emergency, without the possibility of recovery. 

Programming languages, products and technologies: C++, Boost (Serialize, IPC, Program Options, etc), Qt5, Python, Windows RAS API, OpenVPN API, REST API, CMake, TeamCity

#### 11.2012 – 09.2014
[Deutsche Bank – global investment bank](http://db.com/)

Position: Software Engineer

* RAPID Project. The most challenging project in my corporate career I worked on. It was a low-latency trading platform, and I improved latency-critical (<20 mcs for the trading cycle) messaging system performance. At last, I used lock-free algorithms not as programming brain-teaser, but in production.
* RMS Project. A significant risk-management system with multi-tier architecture, I touched modules doing analytics, financial mathematics and distributed computing, but the scale of the system was 100 times more than I knew. Here I worked closely with the analytics team, converting business requirements to software architecture and program code, and providing support to business people (sometimes despite an 8-hour time zone difference). I took part in refactoring, decomposing legacy code (basically, made it at least readable) and covering it with unit-tests. I significantly improved the continuous integration pipeline based on the TeamCity server and automation using Python and REST API

Programming languages, products and technologies: C++11, Boost, MS Excel/VBA, Python, XML/XSL/XPath, CppUnit, Oracle 11g, TeamCity, REST API

#### 07.2011 – 08.2012
[Numerix LLC – analytics provider for derivatives and financial products](http://numerix.com/)

Position: Senior Software Developer

My primary projects was Numerix CrossAsset, a flexible platform for structuring, pricing, and risk managing derivatives, accessible through Excel add-ins, C++, C#, or Java API. My role included project design, development, bug fixing, profiling and optimization using Valgrind (e.g. I increased the speed of internal database about 4 times using system-dependent optimizations), also I did some QA automation job, introducing writing black-box tests in Python for my team, since numbers are very testable.

Programming languages, products and technologies: С/C++, Python, Excel COM API, WinAPI, POSIX API, Valgrind

#### 01.2010 – 07.2011
[Transas – world-leading developer and supplier of marine and aviation onboard equipment and training simulators](http://www.transas.com/)

Position: Software Developer

Projects:

* Gravity Project. Designed and developed land equipment and onboard software for forest fire monitoring UAV (Unmanaged Aerial Vehicle), including GUI of navigation modules, manual control module, and video processing. My role included the full-scale development tasks – application design, bug fixing, codebase maintenance, writing unit- tests, and performing code review.
* A number of internal projects. I developed X-Window events logging module for a complex security and monitoring system, using Xlib API, implemented a script toolset to simplify development, testing and deployment tasks. Used tools are Python and Shell scripting.

Programming languages products and technologies: С/C++, Java SE, Python: gcc, g++, gdb, Strace, Autotools, CMake/CTest, XML/XSL/XPath, NVidia CUDA, Google Test, Apache Qpid (AMQP messaging middleware).

#### 07.2006 – 07.2009
[Doctor Web – Software Company specialized in anti-malware and security solutions](http://www.drweb.com/)

Position: С++ developer.

Here’s where my Software Engineer career has started. I wanted to touch as much as possible, but also I wanted to participate in a whole cycle from design analysis to release. Kind of success in it.

Projects:

* Doctor Web Security Space. My first project was a multi-module solution for the protection of workstations and small servers against malware. First I was working on a custom windows control library for GUI, but also implemented multiple modules on my own, like C++ SQLite library, asynchronous RPC-server for Windows, as well as some routine work like legacy codebase maintaining, fixing some bugs and refactoring.
* Doctor Web Updater. It’s a cross-platform module, supposed to update any company product, from Windows antivirus to server-scale solution for ISP, scanning internet traffic for threats. Since that point, I realized that C++ is good for any operating system. I implemented a cross-platform update service using Boost libraries, and an embedded Lua module for flexibility. Also, I created a Linux toolset for update service: binaries signing, data packaging, and script composer, the application which composed Lua script stubs based on initial requirements.

Programming languages, products and technologies: C/C++, Lua, MS Visual Studio, STL, Boost, MFC, WTL, GDI+, XML, Watcom, Make, GCC

### Education
Master in Software Engineering, Saint-Petersburg State Polytechnic University, Faculty of Management & Information technologies, 2010

I had the best average grade in the group, experience in student conferences and publications
